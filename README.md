# React To-Do Application
## Live-Link: https://todo-task-managment.netlify.app/

This project is a simple and intuitive To-Do application built using React.js and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are persisted in the browser's local storage, so they are not lost on page reload.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks.
- **View Tasks**: Users can view all added tasks.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed using a checkbox.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in local storage.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Local Storage**: For persisting tasks across page reloads.

## Note

This project does not use React Redux for state management. State management is handled using React's built-in `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
